            In the course of registering for or using the Services, you may be required to
            provide Cuerre with certain information, including your name, contact information,

            account changes, you must notify Cuerre promptly and keep such information current.
            You are solely responsible for any activity using your Credentials, whether or not
            you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Cuerre of any
            unauthorized use of your Credentials or if your email or password has been hacked
            or stolen. If you discover that someone is using your Credentials without your
            consent, or you discover any other breach of security, you agree to notify Cuerre
            immediately.

            reviews, recommendations, and other materials may be made available through the
            Services by Cuerre or its suppliers (“Content”). While Cuerre strives to keep
            the Content that it provides through the Services accurate, complete, and
            up-to-date, Cuerre cannot guarantee, and is not responsible for the accuracy,
            completeness, or timeliness of any Content. You acknowledge that by using

            such Content. Furthermore, certain aspects of the Services may function to alert
            users of potential suspicious activity and threats (“Alerts”). Such Alerts are
            opinions generated by the Services. Accordingly, in no circumstances will Cuerre
            be liable for defamation, libel, or any similar claim as a result of the Alerts or
            any components of the Services used to generate Alerts.
        </p>

            All such information is referred to below as “User Content.” You agree that you are
            solely responsible for your User Content, and for the consequences of your actions
            (including any loss or damage which Cuerre may suffer) in connection with such User

            for any or no reason. Cuerre may remove your User Content from the Services at any
            time if you violate these Terms or if the Services are canceled or suspended. If
            User Content is stored using the Services with an expiration date, Cuerre may also
            delete the User Content as of that date. User Content that is deleted may be
            irretrievable. You agree that Cuerre has no responsibility or liability for the
            deletion or failure to store any User Content or other communications maintained
            or transmitted through use of the Services. Cuerre reserves the right (but shall

            discretion. You agree to immediately take down any User Content that violates these
            Terms, including pursuant to a takedown request from Cuerre. In the event that you
            elect not to comply with a request from Cuerre to take down certain User Content,
            Cuerre reserves the right to directly take down such User Content. By submitting,
            posting or otherwise uploading User Content on or through the Services you give
            Cuerre a worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt,
            modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such

            These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy and Pricing Terms, constitutes
            the entire agreement between the parties relating to the Services and all related
            activities. These Terms shall not be modified except in writing signed by both
            parties or by a new posting of these Terms issued by us. If any part of these
            Terms is held to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part shall be deemed
            severed and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
            provisions. The failure of Cuerre to exercise or enforce any right or provision
            under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Any
            waiver of any right or provision by Cuerre must be in writing and shall only apply
            to the specific instance identified in such writing. You may not assign these
            Terms, or any rights or licenses granted hereunder, whether voluntarily, by
            operation of law, or otherwise without our prior written consent. These Terms
            and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of Spain without
            regard to its conflict of laws provisions.
