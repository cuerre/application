        <h4>Parameters</h4>
        <p>
            In order to make this easy for everyone, we accept a JSON structure as input or
            ordinary post parameters encoded as application/x-www-form-urlencoded
        </p>

        {{-- id --}}
        <p>
            <span class="font-weight-bolder">
                id 
                <code>(mandatory)</code>
            </span>
            <p>
                The id of the code you want to modify. This <code>id</code> is given by <code>GET /code</code>
                or during creation of the code with <code>POST /code</code>
            </p>
        </p>

        {{-- name --}}
        <p>
            <span class="font-weight-bolder">
                name 
            </span>
            <p>
                A name to identify your code. Numbers, characters, symbols or spaces can be used. 
                Feel free for organizing your mind as you want.

        {{-- targets--}}
        <p>
            <span class="font-weight-bolder">
                targets 
            </span>
            <p>
                An array of targets. Targets are defined to send your visits to different 
                places according to the platform or browser they use or country they are visiting from.
                Each one is defined with a key setting the source and value setting the destination. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There is a target called 'any' that must be always defined as a fallback to send visits 
                when other targets are not defined or something fail. If you want to send all visits to a website
                this is the target you have to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Allowed targets: 
                @php 
                    foreach(App\Code::ALLOWED_TARGETS as $key => $value){
                        echo '<code class="mx-2">'.$value.'</code>';
                    }
                @endphp
            </p>
        </p>

        {{-- active --}}
        <p>
            <span class="font-weight-bolder">
                active 
            </span>
            <p>
                This parameter can be <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> and determines 
                if the code is active (and redirects, take stats), or not
            </p>
        </p>

        <h4>How to use it</h4>
        <p>
            Almost every programming language has the skill to communicate with servers. 
            cURL is a client, a library that is ready out-of-the-box to make a request and get the response.
            The easiest way to test or use our service is using cURL and that is the reason we use it in our first example.
        </p>

        {{-- bash request --}}
        <div class="mb-5">
            <p>
                With the following code, you will update a QR code redirecting all visits to a website.

            The response for this route include some useful information

        <h4>Errors</h4>
        <p>
            All developers need to test the tools to learn how to use them. It is a daily task 
            to fail. For those cases we answer with HTTP error codes like 4xx, 5xx... and 
            have an easy-to-understand response like the following.
